        <h2>Podcasting</h2>
      <p>I co-produced the <i>Poetry as F*ck</i> podcast with <a href="https://rossmccleary.com/">Ross McCleary</a> between 2015 and 2020.</p>
      <p>This was a monthly spoken word podcast that comprised of three different formats: <a href="https://www.theskinny.co.uk/festivals/edinburgh-fringe/comedy/poets-against-humanity-comedy-spotlight"><i>Poets Against Humanity</i></a>  - a Creative Commons remix of <i>Cards Against Humanity</i> 
      where we wrote fresh cards for each show and asked poets to ruin each others' work with them. Secondly we had <i>Lies, Dreaming</i> which was a theme-driven submission show, where we asked people to send in their work on a certain theme (such as 'A piano, falling' or 'Tim Henman').
      Thirdly we had 'Eight Poems That, If You Had To Be Trapped In Some Way For a Prolonged Period of Time With Little Hope Of Rescue', which was essentially <i>Desert Island Discs</i> but with poems.</p>
      <p>We also produced podcasts where we asked poets and performers to produce either a feature set or a longform piece of spoken word. You can buy these <a href="https://poetryasfuck.bandcamp.com/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>In 2020 we stopped making the podcast due to time and budget constraints. The whole project was archived at the British Library but you can listen to
      four episodes of it <a href="https://soundcloud.com/poetryasfuck">here.</a></p>
      <p>In 2021/22 I was Writer-in-Residence at <a href="https://blogs.glowscotland.org.uk/nl/olhsmotherwell/">Our Lady's High School</a> in Motherwell, working with an S3 class on podasting, sound design, audio storytelling and freewriting. This was financed through Scottish Book Trust's <a href="https://www.scottishbooktrust.com/writing-and-authors/live-literature/school-residencies">Schools Residency Programme</a>.</p>
