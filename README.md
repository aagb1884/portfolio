If you're trying to get on to my portfolio site, and are instead looking at this GitHub readme, please let me know via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-blair-3604a0273/). Usually this means I have just updated my site, and it will correct itself in a few hours, but it's always worth me keeping an eye on it. 

# How I Built This

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Additional Reference Points

For different parts of the site, I used:

* [React Slideshow Image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-slideshow-image)
* [Deploy React App With Github Pages](https://medium.com/@madelinecorman/deploying-your-react-app-with-github-pages-and-adding-a-godaddy-custom-domain-name-50a99accd455)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
